World Negative One
==================

World Negative One is a DC Hub suite built, currently, using the PtokaX DC Hub as the primary serving platform. It is a file-sharing network hosting platform having scripts that make the experience (both as a host and a client) more fun and easy.

The project as of now is in its infant stages of development and dreams of becoming a full-fledged file sharing social network in the future.

Extensive documentation of the project is contained in the "Documentation" directory.

Our areas of interest: Web Development, Search Algorithms, Machine Learning, Network Programming etc.

If you wish to help in developing this hub further with us, send a request at our mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/worldnegativeone
